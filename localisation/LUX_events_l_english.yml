They whine about it daily, but of course we would need a good reason to get rid of such a highly skilled field martial. However, recently Chad has let the fame go to his head and he taunts them at any time he gets a chance. A local nose bandit has been 'getting' peoples noses all over the place and we believe he has potential to become a great replacement for Chad."
 luxembourg.12.a:0 "This 'Got your nose kid' seems promising"
 luxembourg.12.b:0 "CHAD IS LOVE, CHAD IS LIFE"
